About Me
======
I'm a master student from [Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ms-dsml-v1/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research interest includes natural language processsing, machine learning, large language model and AI safety.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael](https://michaelshieh.com/) of [John AI Lab](https://john-ai-lab.github.io/) from [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore. I was advised by [Prof. Shen Ying](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher02/1371452.htm/) from [School of Intelligent Systems Engineering](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/index.htm/), [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn).
